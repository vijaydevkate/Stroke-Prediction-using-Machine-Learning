# Stroke-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

his project is aimed at predicting the likelihood of an individual experiencing a stroke, based on their medical history and other health-related parameters. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions.

Methodology:
The first step in this project is to preprocess the data, which involves cleaning and transforming the data into a format that can be easily used for analysis. The next step is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different variables and identify any outliers or missing values.

Results:
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 95%, indicating that it can accurately predict whether an individual is at risk of experiencing a stroke. This accuracy was achieved through the proper selection of features and appropriate tuning of the hyperparameters of the logistic regression algorithm.
